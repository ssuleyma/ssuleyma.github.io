### About me
In 2017, I was working as a Financial Analyst and 100% of the time I was utilizing MS Excel to prepare various reports. 
As a person who is obsessed with productivity, I decided to search for alternative tools to facilitate some of the tasks I was conducting. Eventually, I utilized an AI-powered reporting tool to conduct one of the tasks and reduced the workload to a day from a week.  The power of AI fascinated me and I decided to shift my career. That is why after graduating from the university I spent 4 months learning AI and Machine Learning and eventually became a self-taught Data Scientist. 

As the field of AI continues to evolve and develop I too continue learning and growing. Summaries of the lessons learned are available as blog posts:

### Projects I created
- [Healthcare QRS Analysis](https://github.com/ssuleyma/Healthcare-QRS) - <i>2018</i>
  - A normal ECG heart signal consists of a periodic pattern. Different points in a signal period of this pattern are labeled as P,Q,R,S and T. The QRS complex corresponds to the depolarization of the right and left verticles of the human heart. If they are working efficiently, the QRS complex is 0.08-0.12 seconds in duration. In this project, I conducted ECG analysis to detect QRS complexes and their duration. As the data is being analyzed, waveform graphs and numerical metrics are displayed to monitor the healthcare metrics of the patient.
  - **Tools** - Biosppy, Matplotlib, Plotly
  - **Category** - Anomaly Detection

- [PersonalityHR](https://github.com/ssuleyma/PersonalityHR) - <i>2019</i>
  - Nowadays, it is very hard to find qualified talent because the traditional processes to assess candidatesâ€™ skills are flawed and biased. When hard skills could be measured by tests or take-to-home projects, measuring soft skills with multiple-choice questions is definitely not the best way. One could entrust this task to the hiring manager, but who guarantees that there will be no bias? This project demonstrates how AI could be utilized in the hiring process to identify the soft skills of candidates, match those with the values of the company, and compare the candidates.

- [Real Estate AI](https://github.com/ssuleyma/RealEstateAI) - <i>2020</i> 
  - Moving to a new place is exciting and challenging. Since apartment hunting is very time-consuming, people mostly pay attention to price and neighborhood safety and rarely do they care about amenities around the neighborhood. AI-based real estate advisor recommends neighborhoods to people who move to a new city or country that match their lifestyle and budget the best.
